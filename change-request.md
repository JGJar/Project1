# Change Request

## Proposed Change
The proposed change is to add an embedded Google Map to the Midterm Project website that displays my hometown. The map will be integrated into the homepage using the Google Maps embed feature so visitors can visually see the location instead of only reading about it.

## Reasons for the Change
The stakeholder requested this feature to make the website more interactive and informative. Adding a map provides visual context and improves the overall presentation of the site. It also aligns with the goal of enhancing user experience and making the content more engaging.

## How This Change Will Add Value
This change will improve usability and visual appeal. Visitors will be able to quickly identify the location without needing to search for it themselves. It increases professionalism and adds an interactive element, which strengthens the overall quality of the website. The feature also demonstrates the ability to integrate third party tools into a project.

## How This Change Will Affect the Constraints
### Time:
Adding an embedded Google Map will require additional development and testing time. However, since Google provides an embed code, implementation time should be minimal.

### Scope:
This change slightly increases the project scope because it introduces a new feature not included in the original requirements.

### Quality:
If implemented correctly, this feature will improve the quality of the website by enhancing user experience and visual design.

### Resources:
Minimal additional resources are required. The Google Maps embed tool is free and does not require custom development beyond HTML integration.

### Budget:
There is no direct financial cost since the embed feature is free. Therefore, budget impact is negligible.

### Risk:
There is minor risk related to formatting issues or compatibility with the existing layout. However, overall technical risk is low due to the simplicity of the embed feature.
