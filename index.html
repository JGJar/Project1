    <h2>Computing Applications</h2>

    <p>
        My goal for this course is to strengthen my understanding of web technologies and project planning concepts.
        I want to learn how to structure projects effectively before starting development so my work is more organized
        and efficient.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the long term, I hope to build a career in the technology field where I can combine problem solving skills
        with my interest in computers and gaming. This course is an important step in developing both technical and
        planning skills that are valuable in real world projects.
