# Project Scope Statement

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a simple personal webpage while practicing project scoping and basic HTML skills. This website introduces who I am while connecting my interests in gaming and technology to structured project planning. The project demonstrates how defining scope helps keep technical projects organized and manageable.

## Project Description
This project consists of a single page website built using basic HTML. The webpage includes my name, my major in computing applications, my interests in gaming and technology, a short description of my academic and career goals, a list of personal hobbies such as PC gaming and anime, and a link to my GitHub profile. The website is designed to be informational and focused on content rather than visual design.

## Project Deliverables
The deliverables for this project include one HTML file named index.html and one scope document named scope.md. The index.html file contains all required content and displays correctly in a web browser. The scope.md file documents the project purpose, boundaries, and expected outcomes.

## Desired Results and Acceptance Criteria
The desired result is a functional webpage that meets all assignment requirements and displays correctly in a web browser. The project will be considered successful if the webpage includes all required HTML elements, follows basic semantic structure, and clearly presents the intended content. Both files must be completed and submitted according to the assignment instructions.

## Assumptions and Constraints
This project assumes access to a computer, a web browser, and a basic code editor. The project is constrained by the requirement to use only basic HTML and to complete the work within the timeframe of the assignment. No advanced tools, frameworks, or scripting languages are used.

## Exclusions
This project will not include CSS styling, JavaScript, animations, images, databases, or multiple webpages. The focus of the project is on defining a clear scope and creating a simple HTML structure rather than developing a fully styled or interactive website.
